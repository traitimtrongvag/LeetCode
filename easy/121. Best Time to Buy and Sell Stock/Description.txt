📖 Title: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
🟢 Difficulty: Easy
🏷️ Topics: Array, Dynamic Programming

------------------------------------------------------------
📝 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a 
single day: to buy one stock and choosing a 
different day in the future: to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 1:: 

   📥 Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]


   📤 Output: : 5


   💡 Explanation: : Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 2:: 

   📥 Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]


   📤 Output: : 0


   💡 Explanation: : In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


🔒 **Constraints:**
: 

 • `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`

 • `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`
