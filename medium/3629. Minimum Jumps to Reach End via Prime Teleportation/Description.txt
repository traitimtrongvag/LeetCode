📖 Title: Minimum Jumps to Reach End via Prime Teleportation
🟡 Difficulty: Medium
🏷️ Topics: Array, Hash Table, Math, Breadth-First Search, Number Theory

------------------------------------------------------------
📝 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

You start at index 0, and your goal is to reach index `n - 1`.

From any index `i`, you may perform one of the following operations:

 • 
Adjacent Step: : Jump to index `i + 1` or `i - 1`, if the index is within bounds.

 • 
Prime Teleportation: : If `nums[i]` is a prime number `p`, you may instantly jump to any index `j != i` such that `nums[j] % p == 0`.

Return the 
minimum: number of jumps required to reach index `n - 1`.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 1:: 

   📥 Input: : nums = [1,2,4,6]


   📤 Output: : 2


   💡 Explanation: : 

One optimal sequence of jumps is:

 • Start at index `i = 0`. Take an adjacent step to index 1.

 • At index `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 2` is a prime number. Therefore, we teleport to index `i = 3` as `nums[3] = 6` is divisible by 2.

Thus, the answer is 2.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 2:: 

   📥 Input: : nums = [2,3,4,7,9]


   📤 Output: : 2


   💡 Explanation: : 

One optimal sequence of jumps is:

 • Start at index `i = 0`. Take an adjacent step to index `i = 1`.

 • At index `i = 1`, `nums[1] = 3` is a prime number. Therefore, we teleport to index `i = 4` since `nums[4] = 9` is divisible by 3.

Thus, the answer is 2.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 3:: 

   📥 Input: : nums = [4,6,5,8]


   📤 Output: : 3


   💡 Explanation: : 

 • Since no teleportation is possible, we move through `0 → 1 → 2 → 3`. Thus, the answer is 3.


🔒 **Constraints:**
: 

 • `1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^5`

 • `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
