📖 Title: Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
🟡 Difficulty: Medium
🏷️ Topics: Hash Table, String, Bit Manipulation, Prefix Sum

------------------------------------------------------------
📝 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Given a string `s`, return *the number of 
unique palindromes of length three: that are a 
subsequence: of *`s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted 
once: .

A 
palindrome: is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A 
subsequence: of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

 • For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 1:: 

   📥 Input: s = "aabca"


   📤 Output: : 3


   💡 Explanation: : The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")


🎯 **Example:**
Example 2:: 

   📥 Input: s = "adc"


   📤 Output: : 0


   💡 Explanation: : There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".


🎯 **Example:**
Example 3:: 

   📥 Input: s = "bbcbaba"


   📤 Output: : 4


   💡 Explanation: : The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")


🔒 **Constraints:**
: 

 • `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`

 • `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
