📖 Title: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
🟡 Difficulty: Medium
🏷️ Topics: Array, Two Pointers, Binary Search

------------------------------------------------------------
📝 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------
Given a 
1-indexed: array of integers `numbers` that is already 
*sorted in non-decreasing order*: , find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 1 2 1`* and *`index2`*, 
added by one: as an integer array *`[index1, index2]`* of length 2.*

The tests are generated such that there is 
exactly one solution: . You 
may not: use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.


🎯 **Example:**
Example 1:: 

   📥 Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9


   📤 Output: : [1,2]


   💡 Explanation: : The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].


🎯 **Example:**
Example 2:: 

   📥 Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6


   📤 Output: : [1,3]


   💡 Explanation: : The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].


🎯 **Example:**
Example 3:: 

   📥 Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1


   📤 Output: : [1,2]


   💡 Explanation: : The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].


🔒 **Constraints:**
: 

 • `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`

 • `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`

 • `numbers` is sorted in 
non-decreasing order: .

 • `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

 • The tests are generated such that there is 
exactly one solution: .
